### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a British software engineer specialising in developing SDLC tooling and with interests including

* Web technologies, like PureScript, TypeScript, and Elm
* Functional programming, such as the above and, of course, Haskell
* Domain specific programming languages (I've worked on several; in academia and in industry)
* Simple electronics, like building a 4-bit processor on breadboards

I've recently completed a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh, and now work at [ResearchSpace](https://researchspace.com).

If you want to reach me, that's best done through the contract details on [my website](https://rlamacraft.uk).
I also run a Gemini Capsule at [gemini://gemini.rlamacraft.uk](gemini://gemini.rlamacraft.uk).
