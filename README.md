### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a British software engineer with interests in FP, DSLs, systems software, and esoterical computing/languages.

My masters thesis was on the static analysis of ISAs, I have experimented with simple electronics, have designed my own simple VMs, and an assembly language in an attempt to gain a more comprehensive understand of computing.

I believe strongly in the applicability of the UNIX philosophy (combining simple tools like vim, git, awk, grep) even in the current era of SaaS technology; that modern software is generally over engineered, and instead want to work on systems that empower users, that try to teach them, rather than confine them to a fixed set of functionality. I have an interest in aggressively minimalist software, and to this end have a gemini capsule at gemini://gemini.rlamacraft.uk
